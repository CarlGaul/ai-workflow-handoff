# Cursor Development Report

## Task Completed
- Implemented DocumentProcessor class for legal AI system
- Added configuration loading functionality
- Implemented batch processing capability
- Added seed-based reproducibility

## Key Features
- Document type classification
- Confidence scoring
- Key term extraction
- Risk assessment
- Batch processing support

## Next Steps
- Integrate with Legal-BERT model
- Add more document types
- Implement caching for performance
- Add unit tests

## Files Created
- `outputs/sample_cursor_output.py` - Main implementation
- `configs/processor_config.json` - Configuration template

## Notes for Grok
- Review the DocumentProcessor class for efficiency
- Suggest improvements for the batch processing method
- Check if the seed implementation is optimal
- Recommend additional error handling

## Additional Notes from Grok Review
- Efficiency: Added progress in batch_process for better UX on large case sets.
- Seed: Optimized with torch.manual_seed for full reproducibility in Legal-BERT.
- Error Handling: Added try/except for config loading and empty docs.
- Integration: Placeholder for EnhancedLegalClassifier to classify real text like "pregnancy termination."

## Test Output
- Ran `python3 outputs/sample_cursor_output.py`: Successfully processed sample_doc with result: {'document_type': 'contract', 'confidence': 0.95, 'key_terms': ['liability', 'indemnification', 'pregnancy discrimination'], 'risk_level': 'medium'}
