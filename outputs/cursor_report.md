# Cursor Development Report

## Task Completed
- Implemented DocumentProcessor class for legal AI system
- Added configuration loading functionality
- Implemented batch processing capability
- Added seed-based reproducibility

## Key Features
- Document type classification
- Confidence scoring
- Key term extraction
- Risk assessment
- Batch processing support

## Next Steps
- Integrate with Legal-BERT model
- Add more document types
- Implement caching for performance
- Add unit tests

## Files Created
- `outputs/sample_cursor_output.py` - Main implementation
- `configs/processor_config.json` - Configuration template

## Notes for Grok
- Review the DocumentProcessor class for efficiency
- Suggest improvements for the batch processing method
- Check if the seed implementation is optimal
- Recommend additional error handling
