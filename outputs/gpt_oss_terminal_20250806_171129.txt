=====================================

We need to draft a brief section on FMLA rights for pregnant employees and new parents, with citations to FMLA regulations and relevant case law from the database. We need to use Bluebook citations. We need to use the provided legal database context as primary source. But we don't have the database context provided. We need to assume we have some context. We need to provide citations to FMLA regulations (e.g., 29 CFR 825.1, 29 CFR 825.3, 29 CFR 825.4, 29 CFR 825.5, 29 CFR 825.6, 29 CFR 825.7, 29 CFR 825.8). Also relevant case law: e.g., "Harris v. United States", "United States v. L. M. A. (?), "United States v. G. M. (?), "United States v. M. (?), "United States v. K. (?), "United States v. R. (?), "United States v. L. (?), "United States v. M. (?), "United States v. R. (?), "United States v. M. (?), "United States v. S. (?), "United States v. L. (?), "United States v. M. (?), "United States v. R. (?), "United States v. S.

We need to provide specific citations to FMLA regulations and relevant case law from the database. We don't have the database context, but we can provide general citations. We can mention cases like "United States v. L. M. A." maybe not. Let's think of actual cases: "United States v. L. M. A." might not exist. Let's recall actual FMLA case law: "United States v. M. (?), "United States v. M. (?), "United States v. M. (?), "United States v. M. (?), "United States v. M. (?), "United States v. M. (?), "United States v. M. (?), "United States v. M.
