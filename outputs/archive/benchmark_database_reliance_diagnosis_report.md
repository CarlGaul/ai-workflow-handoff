# Benchmark Database Reliance Diagnosis Report
## Critical Issue: Models Not Using Local Database, Hallucinating Citations

**Date**: 2025-08-06  
**Analysis**: FamilyBeginnings Legal AI Benchmark Performance  
**Critical Finding**: Models are hallucinating citations instead of using local database  

## üö® EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The FamilyBeginnings Legal AI system has a **critical flaw**: despite having a comprehensive local database of 1071 legal documents, the models are **not relying on the database** and instead are **hallucinating citations** and relying on general legal knowledge. This defeats the purpose of zero-hallucination legal AI.

## üìä EVIDENCE OF THE PROBLEM

### **‚ùå What Models Are Citing (Hallucinated):**

**Fictional NY Cases:**
- "Kendall v. City of New York" (145 A.D.3d 629) - **DOES NOT EXIST**
- "Hernandez v. City of New York" (148 A.D.3d 529) - **DOES NOT EXIST**

**General Legal Knowledge (Not from Database):**
- "Young v. UPS, 575 U.S. 206 (2015)" - Famous federal case, not in local database
- "29 C.F.R. ¬ß 825.104(a)" - Standard FMLA regulation, not from local documents
- "Smith v. Johnson & Johnson" - Generic case name, likely fictional

### **‚úÖ What Models Should Be Citing (Actual Database Content):**

**Real NY Cases in Database:**
- "Golston-Green v. City of New York" (2020 NY Slip Op 02768)
- "Castillo v. Montefiore Med. Ctr" (2017 NY Slip Op 07769)
- "Wright v. White Plains Hosp. Med. Ctr" (2025 NY Slip Op 02371)
- "Hernandez v. Robles" (2005 NY Slip Op 09436)

**Real Statutes in Database:**
- Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA) 1978.pdf
- Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) 1990.pdf
- Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) 1993.pdf
- Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (PWFA) 2022.pdf

## üîç TECHNICAL DIAGNOSIS

### **1. System Prompt Weakness**

**Current System Prompt (Config.SYSTEM_PROMPT):**
```
You are an associate attorney specializing in pregnancy discrimination and employment law. You provide comprehensive legal analysis with accurate Bluebook citations.
INSTRUCTIONS:
- Use the provided legal database context as your primary source
- When database context is available, provide detailed analysis with specific citations
- Use Bluebook citation format for all legal references
- Write in professional legal memo format with clear headings
- If database context is limited, provide general legal principles and acknowledge limitations
```

**Problem**: The prompt is **too weak** - it says "use database context" but doesn't enforce it. Models can easily ignore this instruction.

### **2. Context Retrieval Issues**

**Database Status:**
- ‚úÖ 1071 documents in vector database
- ‚ùå Sources showing as "Unknown source" instead of actual document names
- ‚ùå Context not properly formatted with document identifiers

**Sample Retrieved Context:**
```
Source: Unknown source
Text: action to whether it has one" (Basis Yield Alpha Fund (Master) v Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., 115 AD3d 128, supra, citing John R. Higgitt, CPLR 3211 [A] [7]: Demurrer or Merits-Testing Device?, 73 Albany Law Review 99, 110 [2009]).
```

**Problem**: Context lacks proper source identification, making it difficult for models to cite specific documents.

### **3. Model Training Bias**

**Evidence from Responses:**
- Models prefer citing famous federal cases (Young v. UPS)
- Models generate plausible-sounding but fictional case names
- Models fall back to general legal knowledge instead of database content

**Root Cause**: Models are trained on general legal knowledge and naturally prefer citing well-known cases over obscure local database documents.

## üìà BENCHMARK PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

### **Terminal vs Streamlit Comparison:**

**Terminal Benchmarks (No Database Integration):**
- ‚ùå Direct Ollama calls with system prompt only
- ‚ùå No database context provided
- ‚ùå Expected to hallucinate (and did)

**Streamlit Benchmarks (Database Integration):**
- ‚úÖ LegalAI system with vector database integration
- ‚úÖ Database context retrieved and provided
- ‚ùå **Still hallucinating despite database access**

### **Model-Specific Issues:**

**Qwen 2.5:14b (Streamlit):**
- ‚úÖ Good response quality and structure
- ‚ùå Citing fictional cases instead of database documents
- ‚ùå Relying on general legal knowledge

**Llama 3.1:8b (Streamlit):**
- ‚úÖ Good response quality and structure  
- ‚ùå Citing fictional cases instead of database documents
- ‚ùå Relying on general legal knowledge

**GPT-OSS 20b-q6 (Streamlit):**
- ‚ùå Severe repetition loops and hallucination
- ‚ùå Completely broken responses
- ‚ùå Model-specific stability issues

## üéØ ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### **Primary Issues:**

1. **Weak Zero-Hallucination Enforcement**: System prompt doesn't strongly enforce database-only citations
2. **Poor Context Formatting**: Retrieved context lacks proper source identification
3. **Model Training Bias**: Models naturally prefer general legal knowledge over local database content
4. **Lack of Citation Validation**: No mechanism to verify if cited documents exist in database

### **Secondary Issues:**

1. **Inconsistent Model Performance**: GPT-OSS has severe stability issues
2. **Incomplete Benchmark Matrix**: Only 24/72 Streamlit responses completed
3. **Metadata Loss**: Document sources showing as "Unknown" instead of actual filenames

## üîß RECOMMENDED SOLUTIONS

### **Immediate Fixes:**

1. **Strengthen System Prompt**:
   ```
   CRITICAL: You must ONLY cite documents from the provided database context.
   DO NOT cite any cases, statutes, or regulations not explicitly mentioned in the context.
   If a document is not in the context, DO NOT cite it.
   ```

2. **Improve Context Formatting**:
   - Add proper document source identification
   - Include document filenames in context
   - Format context with clear document boundaries

3. **Add Citation Validation**:
   - Check if cited documents exist in database
   - Flag responses that cite non-database content
   - Implement citation accuracy scoring

### **Long-term Improvements:**

1. **Model-Specific Prompting**: Different strategies for different models
2. **Database Quality Enhancement**: Better document processing and metadata
3. **Citation Training**: Fine-tune models to prefer database citations
4. **Response Validation**: Automated checking of citation accuracy

## üìä IMPACT ASSESSMENT

### **Current State:**
- **Zero-Hallucination Goal**: ‚ùå **FAILED**
- **Database Integration**: ‚ùå **NOT WORKING**
- **Legal Accuracy**: ‚ùå **COMPROMISED**
- **Citation Reliability**: ‚ùå **UNRELIABLE**

### **Business Impact:**
- Legal advice may be based on fictional cases
- Citations cannot be verified against local database
- System does not provide promised zero-hallucination benefits
- Potential legal liability from inaccurate citations

## üéØ CONCLUSION

The FamilyBeginnings Legal AI system has a **fundamental flaw**: despite having a comprehensive local database, the models are not properly utilizing it and are instead hallucinating citations. This defeats the core purpose of zero-hallucination legal AI.

**Critical Next Steps:**
1. Fix system prompt to strongly enforce database-only citations
2. Improve context retrieval and formatting
3. Implement citation validation
4. Complete missing benchmark tests
5. Retrain or fine-tune models for database reliance

**Status**: System requires **significant fixes** before it can be considered a reliable zero-hallucination legal AI assistant.
