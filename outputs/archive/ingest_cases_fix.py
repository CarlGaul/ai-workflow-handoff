Ingest Cases Fix for LegalAI Application
========================================

This script fixes the NameError in the ingest_cases method that was preventing
the LegalAI application from starting.

Problem:
- The ingest_cases method was trying to iterate over 'txt_files' variable
- The 'txt_files' variable was never defined, causing a NameError
- This was leftover code from a previous version that processed text files

Solution:
- Removed the text file processing section that was causing the error
- Kept only the PDF file processing which is the main functionality
- Added a comment explaining that text file processing was removed

Usage:
    This fix is applied to src/legal_ai_core.py

    Fix for the ingest_cases method in legal_ai_core.py
