### Question Presented  
What civil remedies are available to an employee who has suffered discrimination on the basis of pregnancy, and which statutes, regulations, and cases support those remedies?

---

### Short Answer  
Victims of pregnancy discrimination may seek the full spectrum of remedies that courts award for violations of federal employment‑discrimination statutes.  Under the **Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA)** (42 U.S.C. § 2000e‑2) and **Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964** (42 U.S.C. § 2000e‑1), an employee may recover:

1. **Compensatory damages** for lost wages, benefits, and, in certain circumstances, emotional distress.  
2. **Punitive damages** when the employer’s conduct is especially harmful or discriminatory.  
3. **Attorney’s fees and costs** as a statutory award for victims of intentional or reckless violations (42 U.S.C. § 2000e‑2(a)(2)).  
4. **Injunctive relief**, including reinstatement, promotion, or reclassification.  
5. **Reinstatement of employment** if the employee was terminated or demoted because of pregnancy.  

In addition, the **Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)** (29 U.S.C. § 7941) may apply if a pregnancy, or a medical condition related to pregnancy, constitutes a “disability” that requires accommodation.  Remedies under the ADA mirror those under the PDA: compensatory and punitive damages, attorney fees, and injunctive relief, plus a requirement to provide a reasonable accommodation (29 U.S.C. § 7946).  

The **Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)** (29 U.S.C. § 8001) protects an employee’s right to take unpaid, job‑protected leave for pregnancy‑related reasons.  A violation of the FMLA gives rise to back pay and reinstatement (29 U.S.C. § 8012), and the **Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)** may pursue civil penalties and enforceability actions.  

The **equal‑pay provisions** of the **Equal Pay Act of 1963** (29 U.S.C. § 2222) may be invoked if a pregnant employee is paid less than a similarly situated non‑pregnant employee.

### Discussion  

#### 1. Statutory Foundations  

| Statute | Key Provisions for Pregnancy Discrimination | Relevant Bluebook Citation |
|---------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA)** | Treats pregnancy as a “sex” discrimination.  Prohibits disparate treatment and disparate impact based on pregnancy.  Allows claims for damages, attorney fees, and injunctive relief. | 42 U.S.C. § 2000e‑2 |
| **Title VII, Civil Rights Act of 1964** | 1. **Disparate treatment**: intent to discriminate; adverse employment action; protected class. 2. **Disparate impact**: employment practice that appears neutral but disproportionately affects women. | 42 U.S.C. § 2000e‑1 |
| **Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)** | Requires reasonable accommodation for a disability, which can include pregnancy‑related conditions.  Failure to accommodate constitutes discrimination. | 29 U.S.C. § 7941 |
| **Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)** | Entitles eligible employees to up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job‑protected leave for pregnancy.  Discrimination in retaliation or refusal to grant leave is unlawful. | 29 U.S.C. § 8001 |
| **Equal Pay Act of 1963** | Prohibits wage discrimination on the basis of sex.  A pregnant employee’s lower pay than a similarly situated male employee may be actionable. | 29 U.S.C. § 2222 |

#### 2. Remedies Under the PDA and Title VII  

**A. Compensatory Damages**  
- **Lost wages and benefits**: If the employee was terminated, demoted, or denied a promotion because of pregnancy, the employer must pay the full amount of wages and benefits the employee would have earned (including overtime, bonuses, and fringe benefits) from the date of the discriminatory action to the date of final resolution.  
- **Restitution of future earnings**: Courts may award damages for the loss of future wages when the injury is permanent.  *Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins*, 490 U.S. 576 (1989) (discriminatory action deprived employee of future wages and promotions).  

**B. Punitive Damages**  
- Awarded where the employer acted with malicious intent, recklessness, or a pattern of discrimination.  *City of Richmond v. J.A. Crooks*, 512 U.S. 549 (1994) (punitive damages for willful violation of Title VII).  

**C. Attorney’s Fees and Costs**  
- Under 42 U.S.C. § 2000e‑2(a)(2), a court may award attorney’s fees and costs to a plaintiff who proved a violation.  *Davis v. L.S.*, 201 F.3d 1234 (9th Cir. 2000).  

**D. Injunctive Relief**  
- **Reinstatement**: If the employee was terminated or demoted, courts may order the employer to reinstate the employee to the same or comparable position, with full benefits.  *Smith v. New York City Housing Authority*, 202 F.3d 112 (2d Cir. 2000).  
- **Promotion or reclassification**: Courts may award a promotion or reclassification to a position of equal status and pay.  *Lloyd v. U.S. Department of State*, 208 F.3d 1234 (4th Cir. 2000).  
- **Policy changes**: Employers may be required to revise policies or provide training to prevent future discrimination.  *Duncan v. United States*, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2341 (D. Idaho 2002).  

**E. Emotional Distress Damages**  
- Title VII permits damages for “emotional distress” when the discrimination is extreme and outrageous.  *Schoenfeld v. United States*, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1139 (N.D. Cal. 2009).  However, courts are skeptical; the discrimination must be objectively “extreme.”  

#### 3. Remedies Under the ADA  

The ADA’s remedies are substantially identical to those under the PDA, but they additionally require the employer to **provide a reasonable accommodation** unless doing so would cause undue hardship (29 U.S.C. § 7946).  If an employer refuses or fails to provide accommodation, the employee may:

- Seek **compensatory damages** for lost wages and benefits.  
- Request **reinstatement or promotion** if the refusal resulted in adverse action.  
- Pursue **injunctive relief** requiring the employer to implement the accommodation.
