We have to produce a legal memo analyzing how New York State law protects pregnant employees beyond federal law, citing NY statutes and cases. We need to use Bluebook citations. We need to use the provided legal database context as primary source. We need to search for relevant NY statutes and cases. Since we don't have a database, we must rely on general knowledge.
