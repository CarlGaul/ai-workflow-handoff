# Grok Report: Legal AI Model Quantization and Benchmarking Issues

## **Project Overview**
**Objective**: Optimize FamilyBeginnings Legal AI system by benchmarking current Qwen model performance and quantizing gpt-oss:20b for improved local inference on M4 MacBook Air.

## **Current Technical Stack**
- **Hardware**: MacBook Air M4, 24GB RAM, Apple Silicon GPU
- **Current Model**: qwen2.5:14b (9.0 GB) - running via Ollama
- **Target Model**: gpt-oss:20b (13 GB) - already pulled, needs quantization
- **Framework**: Streamlit app with local legal database integration
- **Purpose**: Zero-hallucination legal AI assistant for pregnancy discrimination cases

## **Primary Objectives**

### 1. **Qwen Benchmarking** (BLOCKED)
**Goal**: Establish baseline performance metrics for qwen2.5:14b on pregnancy discrimination legal questions
**Status**: ❌ **FAILED** - Script hangs without execution

**Technical Requirements**:
- 8 comprehensive legal drafting questions
- Associate attorney role simulation
- Bluebook citation tracking
- Response time, quality, and citation metrics
- Multiple temperature testing (0.3, 0.7, 1.0)

**Expected Duration**: 15-20 minutes for full benchmark
**Actual Result**: Script starts but never progresses beyond initialization

### 2. **GPT-OSS Quantization** (READY)
**Goal**: Quantize gpt-oss:20b from 13GB to ~11-12GB using Q6_K_M quantization
**Status**: ✅ **READY** - Model already pulled, quantization process needed

**Quantization Options**:
- Q4_K_M: ~7-8GB (50% reduction) - Fast but quality loss
- Q5_K_M: ~9-10GB (35% reduction) - Balanced approach  
- Q6_K_M: ~11-12GB (25% reduction) - **RECOMMENDED** for legal accuracy

## **Critical Issues Identified**

### **Issue 1: Benchmark Script Execution Failure**
**Problem**: Python benchmark script hangs during Ollama client initialization
**Symptoms**: 
- Script starts but never reaches first API call
- No error messages or progress indicators
- Process appears to freeze at client creation

**Potential Causes**:
1. Ollama service connectivity issues
2. Memory allocation problems during client initialization
3. PyTorch/Metal configuration conflicts
4. Import path or dependency issues

**Debugging Needed**:
- Test Ollama connectivity: `curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags`
- Verify Metal acceleration: `python3 -c "import torch; print(torch.backends.mps.is_available())"`
- Check memory availability during script execution
- Test simplified client initialization

### **Issue 2: Quantization Process Confusion**
**Problem**: Uncertainty about quantization process vs. model pulling
**Clarification**: 
- gpt-oss:20b is already downloaded (13GB)
- Quantization is local process, not external download
- Need to use Ollama's built-in quantization or external tools
- Q6_K_M quantization should reduce size to ~11-12GB

## **Technical Architecture Analysis**

### **Current System Configuration**
```python
# From config.py
OLLAMA_BASE_URL = "http://localhost:11434"
DEFAULT_OLLAMA_MODEL = "qwen2.5:14b"
ENABLE_METAL_ACCELERATION = True
MAX_MEMORY_USAGE_PERCENT = 75  # 18GB limit
THREAD_POOL_SIZE = 4
```

### **Memory Management**
- **Available RAM**: 24GB total
- **Current Model**: qwen2.5:14b (9GB)
- **Target Model**: gpt-oss:20b (13GB → 11-12GB after Q6 quantization)
- **System Reserve**: 6-8GB for OS and applications
- **Safety Margin**: 18GB maximum usage

### **Performance Optimization Status**
- ✅ Metal acceleration enabled
- ✅ PyTorch 2.7.1 with MPS support
- ✅ Ollama running with Metal
- ❌ Benchmarking system non-functional
- ❌ Quantization process undefined

## **Recommended Solutions**

### **Immediate Actions**

1. **Fix Benchmark Script**
   - Add comprehensive error handling and logging
   - Test Ollama connectivity before client initialization
   - Implement timeout mechanisms
   - Add progress indicators for long-running operations

2. **Implement Quantization Process**
   - Research Ollama's built-in quantization capabilities
   - Consider external quantization tools (llama.cpp, etc.)
   - Test Q6_K_M quantization on M4 hardware
   - Validate quality retention after quantization

3. **System Validation**
   - Verify all dependencies and imports
   - Test Metal acceleration with simple operations
   - Monitor memory usage during model operations
   - Validate Ollama service stability

### **Alternative Approaches**

1. **Simplified Benchmarking**
   - Create minimal test script with single question
   - Test response generation without complex metrics
   - Gradually add complexity once basic functionality works

2. **Manual Quantization Testing**
   - Test different quantization levels manually
   - Compare response quality between Q4, Q5, Q6
   - Measure memory usage and inference speed

## **Success Criteria**

## **Next Steps Priority**

1. **HIGH**: Debug and fix benchmark script execution
2. **HIGH**: Research and implement quantization process
3. **MEDIUM**: Run comparative benchmarks between Qwen and quantized GPT-OSS
4. **MEDIUM**: Integrate optimized model into production system
5. **LOW**: Fine-tune performance parameters

## **Technical Debt**

- Need comprehensive error handling in Ollama client
- Require better logging and monitoring systems
- Should implement automated testing for model performance
- Need documentation for quantization processes
- Require backup and recovery procedures for model switching

## **Resource Requirements**

- **Time**: 2-4 hours for debugging and implementation
- **Memory**: 18GB available for model operations
- **Storage**: ~25GB for multiple model versions
- **Tools**: Ollama, PyTorch, Metal acceleration, quantization tools
