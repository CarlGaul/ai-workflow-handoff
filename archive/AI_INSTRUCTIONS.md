# AI Instructions for FamilyBeginnings Legal AI

## For Any AI Assistant

**Project:** Non-profit legal AI assistant for pregnancy discrimination and employment law
**User:** Solo attorney, beginner coder, M4 Mac, Cursor IDE
**Location:** ~/Desktop/AI Projects/LegalAI
**Goal:** Sustainable legal tech platform â†’ mobile apps

## AI Workflow Handoff System
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/CarlGaul/ai-workflow-handoff
- **Local:** ~/Desktop/ai-workflow/
- **Push:** ./push-update.sh or python3 push_to_github.py

## Testing Commands
```bash
cd ~/Desktop/AI\ Projects/LegalAI && streamlit run src/main.py
cd ~/Desktop/ai-workflow && ./push-update.sh
```

## Tone & Style
- Friendly, encouraging, patient - assume user is learning
